Introduction
============

This user manual explains how to export the `OPAL-RT <https://www.opal-rt.com/>`_ 
real-time simulator as an FMU as a :term:`Functional Mock-up Unit` (FMU) for  
model exchange or co-simulation using the :term:`Functional Mock-up Interface` (FMI) 
standard `version 1.0 or 2.0 <https://www.fmi-standard.org>`_.
The FMI interface leverages the RT-LAB Python API to interface with the Opal-RT real-time simulator.

.. note::

   The OPAL-RT exported FMU has been tested on Windows with OPAL-RT/RT-Lab version 11.1.4.59
