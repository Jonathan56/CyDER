Introduction
============

This user manual explains how to export the Python RT-LAB API of 
`OPAL-RT <https://www.opal-rt.com/>`_ as a :term:`Functional Mock-up Unit` (FMU) for  
model exchange or co-simulation using the :term:`Functional Mock-up Interface` (FMI) 
standard `version 1.0 or 2.0 <https://www.fmi-standard.org>`_.
The RT-LAB API FMU allows to interface with the OPAL-RT real-time simulator through the FMI API.

.. note::

   The RT-LAB API exported FMU has been tested on Windows with OPAL-RT/RT-Lab version 11.1.4.59.
