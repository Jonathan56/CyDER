============
This user manual explains how to install and use CYMDISTToFMU.
CYMDISTToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows 
users to export the distribution simulation program `CYMDIST <http://www.cyme.com>`_ version 7.2 
as a :term:`Functional Mock-up Unit` (FMU) for model exchange or co-simulation 
using the :term:`Functional Mock-up Interface` (FMI) 
standard `version 1.0 or 2.0 <https://fmi-standard.org>`_.
This FMU can then be imported into a variety of simulation programs 
that support the import of Functional Mock-up Units.
