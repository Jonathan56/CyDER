FMUs exported by SimulatorToFMU
are exported for a a specific version of Python 2.7
(The binaries which exist on GitHub were compiled with Python 2.7.13 ).
If the FMU requires external Python librariesto run, make sure to 
install the libraries on the target machine.
The Python version of the libraries must 
match the version used to compile the FMUs libraries

The realtime folder contains scripts which allow reinitializing
a running opal-rt FMU. Instructions on how to reinitialize are in 
the script itself. The folder also contains scripts for extracting
input names of an ePhasorSim model which will be compiled as an FMU.
