FMUs exported by SimulatorToFMU
 are exported for a specific version of Python 2.7
(The binaries which exist on GitHub were compiled with Python 2.7.13 ).
If the FMU requires external Python libraries to run, make sure to 
install the libraries on the target machine.
The Python version of the libraries must 
match the version used to compile the FMUs libraries

. The realtime folder contains scripts which allow reinitializing 
a running opal-rt FMU. Instructions on how to reinitialize are in 
the script itself. The folder also contains scripts for extracting 
input names of an ePhasorSim model which will be compiled as an FMU.


The main script used to run the HIL is runFMUs_hil_me.py
The FMUs which are needed for the HIL are in the different models folder.

All the FMUs which are based on Python need the path to the Python scripts to be added to the Python path. This was done by creating a folder D:\Users\emma\Documents\GitHub\cyder.scripts and putting all the Python scripts inside of it.
