Introduction
============
This user manual explains how to install and use CYMDISTPy.
CYMDISTPy is a software package written in Python which allows users to export the distribution simulation program `CYMDIST <http://www.cyme.com>`_ version 7.2 or as a :term:`Functional Mock-up Unit` (FMU) for model exchange using the :term:`Functional Mock-up Interface` (FMI) standard `version 2.0 <https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/specifications/v2.0/FMI_for_ModelExchange_and_CoSimulation_v2.0.pdf>`_.
This FMU can then be imported into a variety of simulation programs that support the import of the Functional Mock-up Interface for model exchange.
