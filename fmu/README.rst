CYMDISTToFMU
------------

CYMDISTToFMU is a software package written in Python which allows 
users to export the distribution simulation program CYMDIST (http://www.cyme.com) version 7.2 
as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) for model exchange or co-simulation 
using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) 
standard version 1.0 or 2.0 (https://fmi-standard.org).
This FMU can then be imported into a variety of simulation programs 
that support the import of Functional Mock-up Units.
