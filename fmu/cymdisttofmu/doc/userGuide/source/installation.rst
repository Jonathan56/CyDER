Installation and Configuration
==============================

This chapter describes how to install, configure and uninstall CYMDISTToFMU.


Software requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To export CYMDIST as an FMU, CYMDISTToFMU needs:

1. Python 3.4.x. 32bit

2. jinja2

3. lxml

4. pandas

5. numpy

6. cython 

7. Modelica Parser

8. C-Compiler (for cython and Modelica)


CYMDISTToFMU has been tested on Windows with:

  - Dymola 2017 FD01  (Modelica parser)
  - OpenModelica 1.11.0 (Modelica parser)
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 10 Professional (Includes C-Compiler for cython and Modelica)

.. note:: 

   CYMDISTToFMU can use OpenModelica and Dymola to export CYMDIST as an FMU. 
   
   However OpenModelica does not copy all required libraries dependencies to the FMU.

   As a workaround, CYMDISTToFMU checks if there are missing libraries dependencies and copies the dependencies to the FMU.


.. _installation directory:

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install CYMDISTToFMU, proceed as follows:

1. Download the installation file from the :doc:`download` page.

2. Unzip the installation file into any subdirectory (hereafter referred to as the "installation directory").
 

The installation directory should contain the following subdirectories:

- ``fmu/cymdisttofmu/``

  - ``bin/``
    (Python scripts for running unit tests)

  - ``doc/``
    (Documentation)

  - ``fmuChecker/``
    (fmuChecker binaries for running unit tests)

  - ``fmus/``
    (FMUs folder)

  - ``parser/``
    (Python scripts, Modelica templates and XML validator files)
    

3. Add following folders to your system path: 

 - Python installation folder (e.g. ``C:\Python34``)
 - Python scripts folder (e.g. ``C:\Python34\Scripts``), 
 - Dymola executable folder (e.g. ``C:\Program Files(x86)\Dymola2017 FD01\bin``)
 - OpenModelica executable folder (e.g. ``C:\OpenModelica1.11.0-32bit\``)

   
   You can add folders to your system path by performing following steps on Windows 8 or 10:

   - In Search, search for and then select: System (Control Panel)
     
   - Click the Advanced system settings link.
     
   - Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables, find the PATH environment variable and select it. Click Edit. 
     
   - In the Edit System Variable (or New System Variable) window, specify the value of the PATH environment variable (e.g. ``C:\Python34``, ``C:\Python34\Scripts``). Click OK. Close all remaining windows by clicking OK.
     
   - Reopen Command prompt window for your changes to be active.
    
   To check if the variables have been correctly added to the system path, type ``python``, ``dymola``, or ``omc``
   into a command prompt to see if the right version of Python, Dymola or OpenModelica starts up.


4. Install Python dependencies by running

   .. code-block:: none
   
      pip install -r dev/cymdisttofmu/cymdisttofmu-dependencies.txt


   .. note:: 

     - ``cymdisttofmu-dependencies.txt`` includes the versions of the Python modules which were tested.

     - ``lxml`` cannot be installed using ``pip``. Please download and install the executable (``lxml-3.4.4.win32-py3.4.exe``) from `PyPyi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.4.4>`_. 
   


Uninstallation
