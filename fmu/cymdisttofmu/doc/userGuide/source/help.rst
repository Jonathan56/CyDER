This chapter lists potential issues encountered when using CYMDISTToFMU.

Compilation failed with Dymola
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the export of the CYMDIST failed when compiling the model with Dymola, comment out ``"exit()"`` in 
``parser/utilities/CYMDISTModelica_Template_Dymola.mos`` with ``"//exit()"``, and re-run ``CYMDISTToFMU.py`` 
to see why the complation has failed.

Simulation failed with Dymola FMUs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an FMU exported using Dymola fails to run, check if the version of Dymola which exported the FMU had the ``Binary Model Export`` license.
The ``Binary Model Export`` license is required to export FMUs which can be run without requiring a Dymola runtime license.
You can also inspect the model description of the FMU to see if a Dymola runtime license is required to run the FMU.

Compilation failed with OpenModelica
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the export of the CYMDIST failed when compiling the model with OpenModelica, 
check if the variable ``OPENMODELICALIBRARY`` is defined in the Windows ``Environment Variables``.

``OPENMODELICALIBRARY`` is the path to the libraries which are required by OpenModelica to compile Modelica models.
