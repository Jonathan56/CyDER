# Cyber Physical Co-simulation Platform for Distributed Energy Resources (CyDER)


## Overview

CyDER is a modular and scalable tool for power system planning and operation that will work seamlessly with existing interconnection planning tools in the utilities and be interoperable with future utility software, data streams, and controls. CyDER will maintain and enhance the efficiency and reliability of the power system in a cost-effective and safe manner, being built on three pillars: quasi-static time series (QSTS) co-simulation and optimization, real-time data acquisition, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application.

## Download

Files can be downloaded individually, or as a whole repository.

See the _Clone_ button on the top right for instructions and for programs that use a graphical user interfaces.

To download, edit and add files from a command line, install first a `git` program.

To download all files, run

    git clone https://YOURLOGIN@bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/cyder.git

The edit a file, such as `README.md`, first edit the file, then enter

    git commit -m "Revised README file" README.md
    git push

To add new files, enter something like

    git add filename.xyz
    git commit -m "Added the file xxxx" filename.xyz
    git push
    
To use the git command on `Windows`

1. download and install a `git` client such as [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)[^install] 

2. open the Git Shell

3. From the Git Shell command prompt, 

    create a folder which should contain the files on the CyDER repository by typing
